	<h1>Pyramid of Cheops</h1>
	
	<br>
	<p class="info">
	This pyramid is located in Egypt on the Giza Plateau. It was built in the period of the Old State, about 2560 years BC.
	intended for the tomb of Pharaoh Cheops, probably according to Hemon's design .
	 In Egyptology it is assumed that the construction time was about 20 years.
	The Great Pyramid is part of the Memphis necropolis.<br>
	In ancient times, it was considered as one of the seven wonders of the world and as the only one of them survived the modern era, although not without damage: it lost its face and treasures.
	The Great Pyramid was placed on artificially leveled terrain, the measured level differences are up to 2 cm.

	<p class="info">
	The pyramid uses 3 different materials: two limestones and a granite, so everything is made of stone, there is no wooden part or whatever else.

<p class="questions">The phenomenon of apothema</p>
<br>
	<p class="info">
	The pyramid has four sides that look perfectly straight, but in reality each side is very slightly curved, they follow an edge that divide them into two equal parts, from top to bottom.
	 The pyramid of Kheops has eight sides, not four, but this peculiarity, which is very little marked, is visible only at the equinoxes, on the days when the solar rays shave both sides North and South.
	 At this moment we see that these two faces are bicolour: One half is in the shade, the other in the sun.
